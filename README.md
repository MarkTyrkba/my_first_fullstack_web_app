# my_first_fullstack_web_app

YEAH, this is my very first fullstack web application. In this project, I am using JS for the frontend, Rust with the Actix-web framework for the backend and the SQLX for the db, and PostgreSQL as the main database.

Note: Before starting this project, I had been learning JS for 2 days and Rust for approximately 2 weeks.
